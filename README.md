# Interpretable Machine Learning for Credit Scoring

This repository contains the R project accompaning my bachelor's thesis "Interpretable Machine Learning for Credit Scoring".
It consists of a R markdown file and the data used for the empirical evaluation, which was taken from the "give me some credit" Kaggle challenge^(1).

The skript can be split into three parts. The first deals with importing, cleaning, and transforming the data as well exploring the correlations between the variables. In the second part, we build a random forests model to generate predictions for the target variable, SeriousDlqin2yrs, which we then model using logistic regression. Lastly, we generate Shapley values to analyse the impact each feature has on the predictions.
